//                                 ThreadBase
//
//  ThreadBase is a wrapper around SDL_Thread.
//
//  It allows the controled creating, halting, pausing, resuming, and
//  destroying or threads.
//
//  It also allows data to be sent to and from the the thread in the form of
//  INFPackets.
//
//  To send data INTO a thread, use the sendToThread().
//  To recive data from sendToThread(), override the handleUserData()
//  function. This function will automatically be called everytime
//  data is sent to the thread using sendToThread().
//
//  To send data OUT of a thread to the outside world, use sendOut()
//  To recieve data sent to the outside of the thread use getOutData(),
//  and outDataReady() to find if there is data sent out.
//
//  Override the work() function to perform what ever actions you will
//  the thread to do. work() should not contain any loops as this will impede
//  ThreadBase's ability to recieve signals from start(), sendToThread(), etc.
//  work() is called repetetivly by ThreadBase anyway. When work returns false
//  the thread will exit.
//
//  A thread can be exited by work() returning false, or end()
//
//  sleep(ms, break) will sleep in blocks of "break" miliseconds, until a total
//  sleep-time of "ms" is reached. During this break time, signals and data
//  from the outside world can be recived
//
//  end() and resume() both work while pause()ed and sleep()ed, so long as
//  sleep()'s break time is high enough.
//
//  The rate is the target number of times work() and signals will be recieved
//  in a seccond. It is the equivelent of setting the frames per seccond
