                                RunContext

    This class is an abstraction of the "Game Loop" concept.
    It allows easy and uniform creation and use of different game loops.

    To pass an argument to a game loop, a private member variable of the
    appropriate data type should be defined. The argument should be passed to
    a specialised constuctor, which stores the value into the private member.

    The constuctor should call run() at the end of its 'constructing'.

    Run always opperates in such an order:
    events, input, logic, draw, (frame limit).

    Control vairbles: the FPS, and wether or not to poll events should be set
    int the Ctor.

    All game loops should inherit from this bas class.
